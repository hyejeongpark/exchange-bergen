          <p>Because of the mountains surrounding the city, Bergen is the city with the most rain in Norway.
          On average, the warmest month is July and the coolest month is January. September is the wettest month and May is the driest month.<br>
          An umbrella will be a handy thing to always carry, but you should know that the wind in Bergen can easily break it. You might need more than one! (and consider buying a rain coat)</p>

          <img src="img/akvariet.jpg" alt="aquarium"><!--https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvariet_i_Bergen#/media/File:Akvariet_Steinbit.jpg-->

        <article id="transportation">
          <h2>Transportation</h2>
          <p>The airport bus (Flybussen) is the transportation from the airport and in to town which will take around 20-40 min depending on the traffic.</p>

          <img src="img/bybanen.jpg" alt="bybanen">
          <p class="credit"> By Nina Aldin Thune. </p>
          <p>The tram (Bybanen) is the most used transportation. If you are going to use public transportation a lot, you might want to consider buying a card (ticket) that will last you a month at the time. Read more about tickets on this site:<a href="https://www.skyss.no" class="underline"> Skyss.no</a></p>

          <p>When moving you probably want to buy some new cheap furniture and other thing to make your new place feel more like home. Then it is good to know that <i>Ikea</i> offers free transportation to their store!</p>

          <p>Taxies in Bergen could be cheaper to use than public transportation, especially during the night, when they turn up the prices for busses/trams. If you are more than three people going home at night, you might want to take a taxi and not the night bus/tram.</p>

        <article id="party">
          <h2>Nightlife in Bergen</h2>
          <p>In Norway the legal drinking age is 18, but to buy and drink liquor you have to be 20.</p>
          <h3>Pre-Party</h3>
          <p>The alcohol is as everything else in Norway, expensive. The students usually throw a pre-party(most Norwegians call it vors) where everybody brings their own alcohol. The pre-party consists of drinking games, music, sing-a-longs and talking, but this will vary from who you are with.</p>
          <h3>Party</h3>
          <p>When everybody has drunk up their alcohol and gotten a bit tipsy, it is time to hit the clubs! Bergen has many pubs and clubs with only a short distance between them. But, if you are under 20 years old, there is not many options to pick from. The best place for you is <i>Kvarteret</i>. All students get in but you have to be 20+ if you are not a student. Kvarteret have different sectors within the club, so that it fits everyone's personality. From those who want to dance, to chill in a lounge, to sing and so on. If you are above 20, you have more options. The most popular clubs and bars are; <i>Kaos, Hulen, Tidi, Lille, Scotsman, Metro, Garage, Cali bar</i> and much more. A good tip is to register to <i><a href="tips.html#apps">VisBergen</a></i>. Which gives you discount on alcohol on different days of the week at Scotsman, Tidi, Lille and Kaos.</p>
          <h3>After-Party</h3>
          <p>When the clubs close, the next stop is the after-party (nach). Many are probably too tired and just want food and sleep, but for those who are still in a party mode, they can go home to somebody and party some more. The environment is more chilled than the pre-party is, the songs are slower but usually still sing-a-long and the conversations are all over the place.</p>
