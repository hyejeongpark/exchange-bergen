          <h4>1. Please introduce yourself briefly.</h4>
          <p>I'm from Seoul, Korea. I'm studying in UIB for one semester.</p>

          <h4>2. Why did you decide to study at UIB?</h4>
          <p>I heard that the nature in Norway is awesome. In addition, my major in Korea is design and there is a web design course in UIB, so I decided to take it.</p>

          <h4>3. What is your favorite thing about UIB?</h4>
          <p>The lecture is very well-organized and the university web system is very useful.</p>

          <h4>4. What do you enjoy doing with your free time?</h4>
          <p>I make some Korean dishes and share with other friends having a dinner party.</p>

          <h4>5. What is your fondest memory of Bergen?</h4>
          <p>Travel beautiful fjords with nice friends!</p>

          <h4>6. What do you think about mentor week?</h4>
          <p>Very nice opportunity to make friends!</p>

          <h4>7. What do you think about transportation?</h4>
          <p>Bybanen is very convenient. It is clean, easy to take, and has free wi-fi.</p>

          <h4>8. What do you think about party in Norway?</h4>
          <p>It's very interesting that there would be pre-party. Because the price of beer in bars is super high, every student try to have some pre-parties in someone's house.</p>

          <h4>9. What do you think about weather?</h4>
          <p>It's not very cold, but rains soooooo much. Actually I don't like strong sunny weather in Korea, but here, I always wait for sun.</p>

          <h4>10. What do you think about housing?</h4>
          <p>Fantoft is a very nice student hostel to socialize. Even though you only have a bed, a desk, and a chair at first, I think it's quite nice to stay.</p>

          <h4>11. Where have you been hiking?</h4>
          <p>Fl√∏yen, Stoltzenkleiven, Kjerag, Preikestolen.</p>

          <h4>12. What was the hardest thing to adjust to?</h4>
          <p>Everything is super expensive..... Also, since day time is quite short and it rains a lot from late autumn, I'm getting groomy easily. </p>

          <h4>13. What is the biggest difference you have noticed between your home country and Norway?</h4>
          <p>Cars stop for you whenever you try to cross the road.</p>

          <h4>14. What do you do when you feel homesick?</h4>
          <p>I make Korean dishes, contact with my family and friends, or listen some Korean musics.</p>

          <h4>15. Something you wish to know before moving to Norway?</h4>
          <p>Korean food is much more expensive than I expected... and it is quite hard to find other Korean students in Bergen.</p>

          <h4>16. Any advice for other students coming next semester?</h4>
          <p>Please share your free time with friends as much as possible! Go hiking, have dinner parties, travel together, or whatever!</p>

          <h4>17. Any tips for what to pack?</h4>
          <p>You should pack everything for hiking. Nice hiking shoes, clothes, and backpack. Heating packs are also useful.</p>
